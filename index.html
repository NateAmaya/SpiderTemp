       <h1>Welcome to Nate Productionz
         Company!</h1>
       <p>This is a free site where we make videos and create videos for people who want to go into the film industry.
      I am an editor, producer and an actor. I have a degree in film production and I have been making videos ever since I knew what a camera was.
       Our company is very hard working and has amazing customer service. We made several videos that can help you grow as an editor and producer. We have also posted some films that we have worked on throughout our time together and would work with you to create your own or perhaps help us!</a></p>

We dont ask for money, but instead for thier time and wanting to help make a diffrence in the world in videos. <p2>
